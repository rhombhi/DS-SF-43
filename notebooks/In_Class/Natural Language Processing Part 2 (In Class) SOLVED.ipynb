      "\n",
      "For our 2017 keynote, I joined forces with We Are Social’s Sydney MD, Suzie Shaw, to explore the impact that algorithms and machine learning are having on every aspect of our lives, and what that means for marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll find our complete presentation in the SlideShare embed above (click here if that’s not working for you), but we thought it might help to dig a bit deeper into our narrative too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Algorithms are everywhere\n",
      "\n",
      "More than half of the world’s population now uses the internet, and we’re increasingly taking that connectivity with us wherever we go thanks to our smartphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "This ‘always on’ connectivity gives us access to a wide variety of digital services: social media, streaming video and music content, gaming, shopping… even dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these various apps and programs aren’t just dependent on data connectivity; they also make use of ‘algorithms’.\n",
      "\n",
      "The influence that these blocks of code have on our lives has grown exponentially in recent years, to the extent that they now shape many of the most important aspects of our lives: who we’re friends with, how much we earn, the economic mood of nations… even who we marry. As a result, algorithms are already influencing the entire future gene pool of humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, why are we delegating such critical decisions to machines?\n",
      "\n",
      "The new decision-makers\n",
      "\n",
      "As our lives are becoming increasingly rushed and complex, algorithms help us to make more efficient and effective choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether you’re struggling to make sense of too many options, feel overwhelmed by complexity, don’t care enough about the answer, or you’ve simply run out of ideas, there’s always an algorithm that can help. However, this increasing reliance on connected tech and algorithms is changing the way our brains work and fundamentally changing the ways in which we make decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, algorithms will soon replace mass media advertising as consumers’ primary source of discovery, and they will become the dominant influence in our decision-making, too. In the future, the survival and success of every brand in the world will depend on how well it can market to the machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "And — with fundamental changes to the way people shop already taking place — that future is closer than we might think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking shop\n",
      "\n",
      "If you listen to the way people talk about their shopping, you’ll notice that they talk about needs and categories more frequently than they talk about brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average shopping list is more likely to include ‘beer, chips and ice cream’ than ‘Heineken, Lay’s, and Ben & Jerry’s’.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what happens if this behaviour translates into the way people use voice-powered devices like Amazon’s Echo?\n",
      "\n",
      "If a shopper asks Alexa to add beer, chips and ice cream to their cart, who decides which brands actually get added? There are four likely scenarios:\n",
      "\n",
      "The device asks the shopper to specify a brand; An algorithm selects from the shopper’s predefined preferences, or adds their most recently purchased choice; The device offers the shopper some options using some form of algorithm (e.g. ‘people like you also bought…’); or The device decides on behalf of the shopper, with the decision based on various algorithmic inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what might these ‘various algorithmic inputs’ be?\n",
      "\n",
      "Google knows more than Santa Claus\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon can tap into more than 20 years’ worth of shopper data, collected across millions of visitors and billions of interactions on its sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Facebook’s dataset is even richer. In addition to the insights the company has been collecting across its own platforms for the past decade, it can also track people’s activities across any third-party website or app that features its ‘like’ button.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even Facebook’s dataset looks thin compared to Google’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Google is already present in almost every aspect of our lives; from answering our questions, to entertaining us, supporting us in our work, and even helping us navigate the real world, Google is with us everywhere we go. This broad portfolio of products and platforms means there’s almost nothing that Google doesn’t know about us. Thanks to Google Calendar, the company even knows what we’ll be doing in the future. But it’s when we dig deeper into the data collected by our smartphones that the real scope of algorithms’ influence becomes apparent:\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when you’re not using your phone, its motion sensor captures how quickly you move and how far you travel – data which can reveal insights into your emotional state. — Motherboard\n",
      "\n",
      "With these platforms and devices now tracking the behavior of billions of people around the world, the real challenge is making sense of all this data.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we’re turning to algorithms for help with that, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intelligent Machines\n",
      "\n",
      "As recently as 20 years ago, few people believed we’d see truly ‘intelligent’ systems in our lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "That belief was turned on its head last year though, when Google’s AlphaGo algorithm defeated 18-time Go world champion, Lee Sedol.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI isn’t just beating humans at board games, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning has allowed algorithms to progress beyond the current boundaries of human intelligence, and these systems now outperform us when it comes to programming driverless cars, and even diagnosing cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "With progress like this, it’s easy to imagine a future in which we’ll all rely on algorithms to manage all of the most critical things in our lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that worries you, you’re not alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding the risks\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the world’s best minds have expressed concern at the rapid advancement of AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elon Musk believes that “artificial intelligence is our greatest existential threat,” while Stephen Hawking shares similar concerns:\n",
      "\n",
      "Success in creating A.I. would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it’s important to stress that AI isn’t a threat to humanity in the way that it’s often portrayed in science fiction movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humans and machines don’t compete for the same mates, and it’s unlikely that we’d ever compete directly for essential resources, either — even if we take energy into consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we ever did get to the stage where humans and AI systems competed directly for energy, it’s likely that the AI systems would quickly realize that the optimum solution would be to leave Earth, and leave humans behind. In all likelihood, when it comes to threats from AI, it’s not the robots we need to worry about; it’s ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for human abuse of AI is very real, too — the United States Department of Defence even believes that AI warfare is “inevitable”.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, how do we mitigate this truly terrifying prospect?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentient systems\n",
      "\n",
      "Empathy is a trait that many of us might think of as characteristically human, and one that sets us apart from most other animals, let alone machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, studies show that children only start to demonstrate true empathy from the age of four, which suggests that a considerable component of empathy is learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "And anything that is learned can be encoded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial empathy may seem like another concept taken straight from science fiction, but ‘empathic’ machines already exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, SoftBank’s Pepper — a device that is already commercially available — demonstrates “more emotional intelligence than your average toddler.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, coding for empathy is more complex than coding for intelligence, mainly because empathy is more individually and culturally subjective.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the development of ‘universal’ systems empathy will be fraught with challenges, and it’s likely to be a number of years before empathetic systems become widespread.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, with our smartphones already able to infer our emotional state, this future may not be as distant as we might think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Averting the apocalypse\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussion of empathetic systems often centers on how machines will relate to humans, but how they relate to each other is of equal concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s highly unlikely that empathetic systems will all be produced by the same organisation, nor will they be coded by the same individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, just as we see in the conflicts between different human cultures today, there’s a risk that these systems will not be as ‘compatible’ as we might hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the US Department of Defence’s prediction that “AI warfare is inevitable” comes true, what role would empathetic systems play in that conflict?\n",
      "\n",
      "While it’s difficult to factor the human element in this scenario, it’s likely that any truly intelligent, empathetic system would come to a similar conclusion to that of Joshua, the AI system in the classic 80s movie, WarGames: the best move in war is not to start at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, in contrast to the ‘inevitable AI apocalypse’ portrayed in popular culture, empathetic AI may deliver an outcome that no human has ever achieved: world peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, with the end of the world averted, it’ll be time to get back to the day job.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how do marketers survive in a world powered by such powerful algorithms?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have three tips for you when it comes marketing to machines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Understand where you stand\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easy to feel intimidated by ‘internet giants’ like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, but these businesses still rely on other organisations to produce the majority of the products and services that they market or sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, we can think of them as partners, not threats. How can you work together with these companies and use their insights to inspire better value propositions that bring value to all sides?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Understand your ‘audience’\n",
      "\n",
      "Many marketers think of algorithms as incomprehensible ‘black boxes’, but they’re actually more predictable than the irrational behaviour of human consumers. Treat algorithms as just another ‘audience’ and many of your fears will dissipate.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may need to harness new skills for this, of course, but the good news is that you don’t need to become an expert in algorithms; you simply need to know how to identify those experts and persuade them to join your team.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Get started today\n",
      "\n",
      "As machine learning systems perfect their algorithms and write new ones, they will likely create a competitive advantage that will be difficult for late entrants to address. As a result, it’s imperative to get started soon in order to avoid being left behind the curve\n",
      "\n",
      "That doesn’t mean you need to start writing your own algorithms now, but it does mean that you need to start planning for algorithmic marketing today.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like some help getting started, feel free to get in touch with me on Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parting thought\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, it’s almost inevitable that these technologies will result in job losses, just as the Industrial Revolution did 250 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humankind survived that transition though, and provided we don’t use AI to wipe ourselves out, there’s every likelihood we’ll survive this revolution, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s often said that it’s not the strongest of species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one that’s most adaptable to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if we can adapt to this new reality we’re creating for ourselves, we won’t just survive; we’ll thrive.\n",

But, in reality, AI is not just evil robots scheming to dominate us. A comprehensive definition by Gartner, explains AI as, “Technology that appears to emulate human performance typically by learning, coming to its own conclusions, appearing to understand complex content, engaging in natural dialogs with people, enhancing human cognitive performance (also known as cognitive computing) or replacing people on execution of nonroutine tasks.”\n",

Digital voice assistants like Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google’s Assistant make us more efficient by helping us multi-task. While driving we can just ask Siri to read out our messages or reply to emails, or get Alexa to create a grocery list while we are cooking. Google Maps uses real-time anonymized data to show us the best possible route with current traffic conditions, and even estimates the time to our destination. Studying our choices and behavior helps Netflix recommend movies and shows, while Amazon uses that information to help us shop. Email providers automatically categorize emails as spam or fraud depending on the content, saving us time and keeping us safe. When you upload pictures on Facebook, facial recognition software reads and suggests people to be tagged. We don’t even bat an eyelash at these technologies anymore, they have pervaded life to that extent.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence in business and chatbots can greatly improve customer experience, and having realized this, companies are harnessing their power to create more personalized experiences for customers. An improved experience, consequently, has a positive impact on the company’s figures as well. For instance, Amazon saw a 29% increase in Sales, as a result of recommending products to its customers; while movies recommended by Netflix were chosen 75% of the time, by viewers. A simple feature that’s been incredibly effective in creating a win-win situation for customers and companies alike.\n",

At Tesco Labs, they test multiple projects across various technology disciplines like mobile apps, smart homes, augmented and virtual reality. They aim to understand customer buying behavior with respect to pre-purchase, during the purchase, and post-purchase. A study found that 60% of millennials in UK approve of the use of AI by retailers to offer unique products. Putting this together with Gartner’s prediction that by 2020, over 75% of customer interactions will be handled by AI agents, Tesco’s investment in AI is a prudent business move. Shop Direct (Online Retailer, UK) – Using AI, Shop Direct can determine the frequency of communication, and the channels through which it should reach out to customers. Additionally, the company is able to predict why and when customers will stop purchasing from them, and automatically take preventive measures to keep them engaged.

An algorithm hidden in a Facebook Messenger bot elicits feedback from customers, and passes it along to the human brewers. The beer bottles feature codes that direct customers to the bots, which then ask a number of questions on flavors and customer preferences. The algorithm analyzes the information, and refines its questions by learning from the feedback given, using a system called reinforcement learning. From customer feedback, trends are discovered that are used to alter the recipe. AI is helping IntelligentX’s brewers to act on customer feedback much faster than ever before.\n",

      "The future of AI holds limitless possibilities. As technologies are refined, systems will imitate human thinking better, and what is considered AI today, might become common place tomorrow.No matter how AI evolves, be it to provide better healthcare, safety, security, increased efficiency, or predictive and proactive systems, the underlying thought driving its evolution should be enhancement of the customer’s experience. Merely inventing new technologies to do the same thing is not innovation. Ideas that disrupt the existing way of doing things, to bring about improvement, are the ones that should guide the growth of AI.Gartner’s report on the Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends in 2017, lists AI on the top; no surprise there. Further, Deloitte’s 2016 Global CIO Survey, of 1200 IT Executives found that significant investment over the next two years will be in new technologies, 64% of which includes cognitive technologies or Machine Intelligence (MI). This is a clear, undisputable indication of the growing importance of AI.With AI playing a key role in delivering superior customer experience, CSS Corp’s virtual assistant platform Yodaa is a great tool to meet the demands of today’s tech savvy, instant gratification seeking, DIY customers. It integrates multiple customer channels like voice, email, chat, and website; across devices, for a consistent customer experience. Powered by AI, NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming), and data analytics, Yodaa has self-learning capabilities that allows it to provide the most intelligent resolution. Yodaa gives customers the choice to self-service or seek assistance across any channel, at any time, in multiple languages.Another powerful CSS Corp tool driven by AI is Contelli, which stands for convergence of human and machine intelligence.

      "Since Netflix’s new rating system released in April, we’ve seen a slurry of opinion articles crashing down on the change (with over-the-top, clickbaity titles, I might add):\n",
      "\n",
      "There is even a petition going around to change it back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the change has received largely negative reviews (#meta), I believe it to be a mighty improvement from an AI and business perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of using the overwhelmingly common 5-star system, Netflix has switched to a thumbs-down or thumbs-up approach. While this change has received coverage from a wide array of online media outlets, not a single one (according to my research) mentions how this impacts Netflix’s collaborative filtering learning algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "A major interest for Netflix to make this change is to better leverage entry data within their learning algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do so, they needed to move from an objective rating system to a subjective one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer Habits\n",
      "\n",
      "People like the 5-star rating because it is viewed as objective. It basically pools together all the different ratings it received and shows you the average. Google Play’s interface is a great example to better understand this. Let’s take a look at the Netflix app:\n",
      "\n",
      "We can see the app is appreciated because most people rated it 5 stars and that all ratings put together average a 4.4/5. The same goes for content on Netflix. With enough people using it, you tend to get a somewhat good idea if a movie or TV show is good. While this was one of the strengths of the 5-star system, it is also one of the main causes for the change. Obviously, Netflix doesn’t want to log in and see plenty of 1-star or 2-star movies. You would quickly think less of Netflix as a content provider and producer, but I would argue this is only part of the equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five-star rating system is considered objective, but many, if not most, people naturally step out of the system’s intended use. Rather than objectively trying to assess the worth of the content, most people understand the principle that content will be presented to them according to how they rate it, creating a bias in how the system is used. I, for example, am very much guilty of this. I used to rate shows either 1 or 5 stars. My goal was to accelerate content filtering according to my tastes. Some TV shows and movies that could’ve been potentially good to others fell victim to my not-so-objective behavior and the binary rating system I crafted for myself could’ve skewed ratings for others. Even though Orange Is the New Black is a great show, it is not to my liking, so I gave it 1 star. With consumers more and more informed on the principles of recommendation engines, this type of biased behavior could make a big difference in the precision of movie recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of fighting consumer habits, Netflix adapted to them. In my mind, as a marketer, this is always a good thing. When you think about it, I was already using the 5-star system as a binary (thumbs up/down). They want you to think whether it is right for you. It’s all about personalization; moving from a collective, community rating system to a more personalized system.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s All About Entry Data\n",
      "\n",
      "With the 5-star system, things tend to even out when enough people are involved, but with AI data, validity and precision are key to drive valuable results. Building a recommendation engine that uses machine learning to curate content appropriately is way more challenging if your data is unreliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning can be used to assess a large amount of your consumer behavior, compare it to similar consumers, and suggest content that should match those habits. Part of Netflix’s recommendation engine uses collaborative filtering. Simply put, it is a three-step process in which you collect user information, form a matrix to calculate associations, and finally make a recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When working on a learning algorithm, you aim for the most accurate prediction. You end up fighting for tiny percentage points. On scales as large as Netflix, every percentage point can mean the difference between millions of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is precisely why Netflix used to hold an open competition with a grand prize of $1,000,000. From 2006 to 2009, “the Netflix Prize sought to substantially improve the accuracy of predictions about how much someone is going to enjoy a movie based on their movie preferences.” The contest came to a halt in March 2010 when privacy concerns lead to a class action lawsuit against Netflix.\n",
      "\n",
      "At some point, significantly improving the algorithm's’ performance is hardly possible unless you make changes to how your data is sourced. Moving from a 5-possibility (1 to 5 stars) variable to a simpler binary input reduces complexity and provides cleaner, more accurate data.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bonus to the change was an increase in engagement. Netflix reported a 200% increase in user ratings. This means more data and more data means improved accuracy on predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combine the influence on data quality with the fact that we can now use a rating system (with respect to our personal preferences) that's no longer about good or bad content but about matching content, and the reason why they made the change becomes clear. \n",
