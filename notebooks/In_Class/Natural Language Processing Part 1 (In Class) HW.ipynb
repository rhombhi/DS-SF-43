    "\"Tf-idf is a very common technique for determining roughly what each document in a set of documents is “about”. It cleverly accomplishes this by looking at two simple metrics: tf (term frequency) and idf (inverse document frequency). Term frequency is the proportion of occurrences of a specific term to total number of terms in a document. Inverse document frequency is the inverse of the proportion of documents that contain that word/phrase. The general idea is that if a specific phrase appears a lot of times in a given document, but it doesn’t appear in many other documents, then we have a good idea that the phrase is important in distinguishing that document from all the others.\""
